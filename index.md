#### **For many years researchers have investigated the evolutionary forces driving the evolution of primate societies. They have developed socioecological models to study the determinants of primate social organization [1–3], while ecological and intelligence hypotheses have been put forward to explain the evolution of large brains in primates [1,2].** 

#### **Over the last two decades, there has also been an emphasis on understanding the relationship between sociality and fitness in primates and other species. Natural within-group variation has allowed researchers to investigate how sociality positively affects fitness in different primate species [3,4]. For instance, the strength of females social bonds measured through social indexes based on proximity and grooming scores predicts infant survival in baboons [5,6]. Lastly, over the last years, some studies have started to investigate to what extent cognitive performance affects reproductive fitness in different animal species [7,8]. Some of these studies have found positive relationships between different physiological measurements of cognition (e.g., size of different brain regions) and sociality variables such as group size and Social Network Analysis properties (reviewed in [9]). Interestingly, few studies have tested wild populations in different cognitive tasks and have found positive relationships between cognition and reproductive fitness [10–13]. However, these tasks have mainly assessed individual cognitive performance in the physical cognition domain (e.g., memory, associative learning or problem-solving). Therefore, it remains unexplored whether variation in individuals' performance and preferences in social cognition studies interacts with fitness.**

## Project Idea

#### **To shed light on this question, we want to measure the effect of chimpanzees' social preferences and performance during experimental studies on their sociality. However, since our study population is in captivity and thus does not face the environmental challenges of wild populations, we focus on their social fitness, which can be defined as the quality of their interactions and relationships with other group members.** 

#### **To measure cognitive performance and preferences, we will assess around 100 published studies on social cognition in this population. These social cognition studies include work on social interactions (e.g., cooperative, competitive and prosocial interactions), communication (e.g., pointing and iconic gestures) or Theory of Mind (e.g., understanding of goals, perceptions and beliefs). Likewise, to assess social fitness, we will code sociality scores on proximity, grooming, and other social interactions [6] to generate different social networks [14–16] by using video data of weekly focal samples of this group (2001-2020).**

#### **Combining these two datasets (experimental studies and video recordings) will also seek to explore the relationship between early social development and participation, performance and preferences in socio-cognitive taskas at the WKPRC. Early work in other species has shed some light on the relationship between early development influenes on individuals’ socio-cognitive abilities  [17–19]. For instance, [20] found differences in joint-attention and cooperativeness development in young chimpanzees due to differences in emotional engament experiences during early ontogeny. However, while in [20] study their two chimpanzee groups were raised by human caretakers, young chimpanzees in our study population have been raised by their mothers within their eco-social group in Leipzig Zoo. Such naturalistic rearment conditions allows us to specifically explore the influence of mother-infant relationship on social development, as well as the influence of diverse social relatioships between the infant and other conspecific group members such as fathers and sliblings during early ontogeny.**

## Methodological Approach

#### **We will use datasets from publish work at the WKRPC conducted between 2001 and 2020 to calculate apes’ individual scores on cognitive performance and preferences.**
#### **We define cognitive performance as an umbrella term to assess how well an individual performs a task or activity. There must be a precise measure of success or correctness (e.g., obtain a reward or not, pass pre-established criteria or not). Similarly, we define preference as a variable that assesses the tendency to care about the outcomes of others in addition to their own. There is no precise measure of success or correctness.**

#### **We have begun to sort out all the social cognition studies conducted with the A chimp group in the Leipzig zoo between 2004 and 2020. We find +90 relevant studies, of which +50 fall into social interactions (competitive, cooperative, and prosocial outcomes). Alternatively, we have sorted out studies by the cognitive requisites that subjects require to predict others' behavior. To do so, we have extended the recent review by Lewis and Krupenye [21] on ToM to assess our entire dataset.**

#### **To illustrate the approach we envision, we have selected six studies in which dyads of chimpanzees had the opportunity to mutually cooperate to retrieve mutual rewards [22–27]. Here we illustrate the relative performance of each individual concerning the group average. We also illustrate the performance of individuals across the six tasks.** 
#### **Our idea is to use these individual scores as predictors for sociality analysis. To extract the sociality scores, we will use the 5-min weekly focal observations from 2001 to 2020—these results in approximately 52 videos per subject per year. We will code the videos using a recently ethogram we have developed. The ethogram mainly focuses on state events (durations) of proximity, grooming, affiliative and agonistic interactions, sexual behavior, food sharing, and individual activity. In addition, we will scan proximity at the beginning and the end of every video clip. We will BORIS software to code our videos.**
